# Demo-workflows

MatFlow has a number of example workflows that come with the software.

The available workflows can be listing using

```
matflow demo-workflow --list
```

and run as-is using e.g.

```
matflow demo-workflow go <name_of_demo_workflow>
```

You can also copy a workflow for editing before running using

```
matflow demo-workflow copy <name_of_demo_workflow> <destination>
```
